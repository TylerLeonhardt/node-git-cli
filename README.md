node-cli-boilerplate
===

a simple node command line interface application boilerplate for getting up and running quickly.

it sets you up with a simple node app that basically acts like `echo`. You input a message with the message option and it prints it back to you.

mocha is also included with a simple unit test set up for the print function. You can run this with `make test`.

*note:_uses gulp.js to convert coffeescript src but this isn't intrusive and you can just work with the javascript source._

###to get up and running

            git clone https://github.com/jh3y/node-cli-boilerplate.git
